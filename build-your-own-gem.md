##What is a gem?
```
Rubygems provides two things for the Ruby community.

- A remote repository/packaging format and installer
- A runtime dependency manager
```

##Naming your gem
```
Naming your gem is important. 
Before you pick a name for your gem, do a quick search on RubyGems.org and GitHub to see if someone else has taken it. 
Every published gem must have a unique name. 
Be sure to read our naming recommendations when youâ€™ve found a name you like.
```
[Rubygems naming conventions](http://guides.rubygems.org/patterns/#consistent-naming)
